 Spotify-cloned
 A static front-end clone of Spotify built with HTML &amp; CSS â€” no functionality, just clean UI

ðŸŽ§ Spotify UI Clone (Static Page)
This is a non-functional front-end clone** of Spotify built purely with **HTML and CSS â€” made as a personal project to practice layout structuring and styling.
> No music. No backend. Just clean code and a dark-themed UI.
ðŸ§  Why I built this
I wanted to improve my CSS and HTML skills by trying to recreate a complex-looking interface â€” Spotify felt like a fun challenge.
The goal wasnâ€™t to make it functional, just to learn by building something visually close to the real thing.
ðŸ’¡ What I Learned
* How to use Flexbox to structure and align components properly
* Building reusable sections like cards and grids
* Managing consistent spacing, alignment, and sizing across elements
* Creating a dark-themed UI with readable, neat text
* Keeping my HTML and CSS more organized and maintainable
ðŸ§± Whatâ€™s Included
* ðŸŽµ Trending songs section
* ðŸŽ¤ Popular artists layout
* ðŸ’½ Albums & singles
* ðŸ“» Radio and chart highlights
* ðŸ“œ Footer with company links (just like Spotifyâ€™s!)

ðŸš« Whatâ€™s Not Included
* No JavaScript
* No audio functionality
* No responsiveness (yet)
ðŸš§ Status
Still a work in progress â€” just testing and tweaking a few things before I call it done.
